Hi there my name is Fara Zuliana Binti Zulkifli and i am currently pursuing my degree at 
<a href= "https://uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/"> Universiti Teknologi Mara</a>. 
I am the oldest child amongst 3 siblings including me. My hobby is watching netflix on my free time. There are some key features that i am proud of myself.<br><br>

Firstly i am a very open person. This means that i am not a judgmental person. Some of my friends always ask for my advice if they are at their lowest point.<br><br>

Secondly i am also a fast learner. I can catch up fast and can easily understand some things. For instance if there are any new games that have been published, i will try to play it and can master the game in under 1 hour.<br><br>

Lastly is i have a great sets of family and friends.They always support me at my lowest and never give up on me. I am forever grateful to have them in my life.<br><br>
